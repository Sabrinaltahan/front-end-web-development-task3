# front-end-web-development-task3
The task is included in the course "Frontend-based web development".
The purpose of the task is to:
Understand the purpose of CSS preprocessors.
Be able to use SASS to facilitate development with CSS.
Practical use of the development environment you created in previous steps.
Be able to automate conversion of SASS files with Parcel.

Continue working with Parcel (minification, concatenation of CSS and JavaScript, and more).

This should now also be able to convert SASS (scss files) to normal CSS for publication. It should be possible to write SASS files, which when running Parcel should be converted to CSS that can be run in browsers.


the Task:
Create a simple fictional website with content of your choice. The website must consist of at least two HTML pages (but if you want to add more, that's ok). A home page and a sub page called SASS .

Design, structure, etc. you decide yourself. You will continue to develop this website in the next lab, so please put some energy into color and shape.

Requirements for content in this website:

The bottom page SASS must contain an evaluation of your work with SASS. What pros and cons do you see with SASS? How was it to get started working with a CSS preprocessor?
A main menu with at least five menu options (can be linked to only "#").
The website must support light and dark themes with media query. Come up with two color schemes for this.
Responsive web design, both on content and menu. Should work well on large and small devices.
At least two pictures of some kind.
